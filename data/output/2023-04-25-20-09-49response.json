Recently， we also have also been witnessing an increasing trend of new AI technique proposals in the cy ber-physical systems across industrial domains， e.g，autonomous driving， robotics， power and energy， especially in solving problems that could not be achieved by classical solutions (e.g， theory and best practice) under open， wild， or extreme conditions."}]
